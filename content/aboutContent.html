 <h1>THE POCKETFUL is a fresh, fast, health smart, mobile restaurant.</h1>


<p>“The inspiration for THE POCKETFUL was my Grandma Esther, and her wonderful recipes handed down from generation to generation. Grandma was born in 1898 in Hebron and grew up at 36 David Street, in the eternal city of Jerusalem.</p>
 
<p>Grandma immigrated to New York in 1924 and settled in Brooklyn. She may have left her ancestral home, but she brought all her recipes with her that she learned as a child. With family roots stretching from North Africa into the Levant, her talent and creativity was legend. </p>
 
<p>As a child growing up in Brooklyn, I can fondly recall sitting in her Ocean Parkway kitchen and helping her prepare these wonderful foods. It is my pleasure and honor to share the foods with you.</p>
 
<p>Sincerely,</p>
 
<p>Jack Rahmey”</p>
